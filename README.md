Zero config VPN for building secure networks and secure access to your
Home Assistant instance.

## About

Tailscale is a zero config VPN, which installs on any device in minutes,
including your Home Assistant instance.

Create a secure network between your servers, computers, and cloud instances.
Even when separated by firewalls or subnets, Tailscale just works. Tailscale
manages firewall rules for you, and works from anywhere you are.

It also sets up access to your Home Assistant via Tailscale VPN.
